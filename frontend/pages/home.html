					<h6>The Problem</h6>
					<p>For about as long as people have been programming, they have gotten stuck with  hard bugs. Often times however, the bug in question was not as complicated as it first seemed. Upon explaining the problem to another programmer, the answer became clear, without the other developer even needing to speak. Teammates became frustrated with one another for seemingly wasting one another’s time. The developer hours being wasted, just listening other programmer’s problems, was staggering.</p>

				<h6>The Solution</h6>
				<p>One day, an anonomous programmer discovered that upon explaining a bug to an inanimate rubber duck, the same clarvoience came upon them that they usually only got when talking to another developer, and bugs melted before them. Suddenly word spread throughout the programmer ranks and rubber duck debugging, or rubber ducking was born. And the world of programmers was forever linked to the humble rubber duck. Teams everywhere rejoiced at their new found productivity.</p>
