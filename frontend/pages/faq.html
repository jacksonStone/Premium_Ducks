			What makes a premium duck <i>premium</i>?
		</h6>
		<p>Put simply: you know it when you see it. The basis for picking them was if they could make one laugh immediatly. Or how easy it was to imagine a coworker making a cheesey joke with one of them.</p>

			How do I know if I need a duck?

		<p>If you often find yourself messaging someone with a question and then immediatly regretting you did so because you now know the answer or at least further steps you can take, you could use a duck.</p>

			Why would you make such a thing?
		</h6>
		<p>When I’m not peddling mallards, I work as a web developer. One day I stumbled upon “rubber duck debugging” and loved the idea, and how prolific a thing it was among older developers. I too wanted a rubber duck to call my own. But being the nerd that I was, not any old duck would do. I wanted an awesome duck. And that was easier said than done. After serveral hours of searching (I admittedly got carried away) I had compiled a list of ducks I would be proud to call my own.
		</p>
		<p>
			This list was refined further and then became the site you see now, allowing me to share the best of the best when it comes to rubber ducks with others. Amazon’s referal system helps pay the server bills so the whole thing isn’t a net loss. Also all the code is open source (GNUv2) and stored here: <a href="https://github.com/jacksonStone/TDD_Framework" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
